## Requirements

To run this or any other Op, install the [Ops Platform.](https://cto.ai/platform).

Find information about how to run and build Ops via the [Ops Platform Documentation](https://cto.ai/docs/overview)

This Op also requires AWS credentials to work with your account. Here's what you'll need before running this Op the first time:

- **AWS Access Key Id**: via the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/):
  - `AWS Management Console` -> `Security Credentials` -> `Access Keys`
- **AWS Access Key Secret**: via the [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/):
  - `AWS Management Console` -> `Security Credentials` -> `Access Keys`

## Usage

To initiate the interactive AWS CLI prompt run:

```bash
ops run aws
```

## Available Commands ðŸ’¡

To skip the service selection prompt you can run:

```bash
ops run aws [service option]
```

For example, to use the ec2 service you can run:

```

For power users, the Op offers the option to entirely skip interactive prompts, by running:

```text

```
